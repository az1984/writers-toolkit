Cate Green sprawls across the sun-baked grass of the backyard hill, the blades tickling her bare shins. Sweat prickles her temples. Madison flops down beside her, a human puddle in denim shorts.

"Staaarving," Madison groans, rubbing her stomach like a drum. "Stomach's eating itself."

Cate squints against the glare. "PB and J?"

"With extra jelly. The fancy stuff from the farmer's market."

Cate pushes upright, brushing dirt off her palms. "Race you to the kitchen."

Madison springs up, already bouncing on the balls of her feet. "Loser cleans the peanut butter knife!"

They scramble downhill, kicking up clumps of dry earth. Halfway down, Madison freezes. Points.

"Cate." Her voice drops to a hiss. "Look."

Beneath the gnarled oak, two grey squirrels tug a red-checkered picnic blanket toward the thorny blackberry bushes. Each grips a corner in determined jaws, dragging it inch by stubborn inch across the dirt.
