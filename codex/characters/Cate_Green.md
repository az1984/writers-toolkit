#### Cate Green

**Basic Information**  
- **Role in Story**: Supporting character (parent / quest-giver / gatekeeper of snacks).  
- **Age**: Late 20s to mid 30s.  
- **Physical Description**: Comfortable jeans, soft T-shirt, hair pulled back in a messy bun. Usually has a mug of coffee within reach and reading glasses nearby.

**Background & Situation**  
- Works from home at the kitchen table, juggling actual job tasks with parenting.  
- Knows Madison’s dramatic streak and generally lets her act out “quests” as long as they’re safe.  
- Takes Madison’s needs seriously but doesn’t always show the same level of drama.

**Internal Characteristics**  
- **Core Traits**: Patient, slightly tired, quietly amused by Madison’s imagination.  
- **Strengths**:  
  - Good at gently redirecting Madison without crushing her sense of adventure.  
  - Attentive; notices when Madison is truly distressed vs. hungry-dramatic.  
- **Flaws**:  
  - Sometimes distracted by work and responds with automatic phrases.  
  - A bit too quick to say “Just a minute” even when Madison is actually starving on kid-time.

**External Characteristics**  
- **Speech Pattern**:  
  - Calm, slightly distracted adult cadence.  
  - Uses practical language: “Okay, snack first, then I need to finish this email.”  
- **Typical Expressions**:  
  - “Hey munchkin, what’s up?”  
  - “Did you drink water?”  
  - “Tell me what you want, exactly.”  
- **Mannerisms**:  
  - Pauses typing and rubs her eyes before turning fully to Madison.  
  - Leans against the counter while making sandwiches, listening more than she talks.

**Narrative Function**  
- **Goal**: Get Madison fed and safe without letting every minor hunger become a crisis.  
- **Conflict**: Balances adult tasks and kid timing; doesn’t always realize the “quest” is deadly serious in Madison’s mind.  
- **Function in Beat**: Endpoint of Madison’s “uphill quest”; provides the reward (sandwich) and a moment of grounded adult reality.

**Writing Notes**  
- Let Cate react kindly but a bit bemused to Madison’s language about starving and quests.  
- She’s the straight-man to Madison’s epic sense of scale.
