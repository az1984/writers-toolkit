#### Madison Green

**Basic Information**  
- **Role in Story**: Protagonist (POV)  
- **Age**: 6  
- **Physical Description**: Small for her age, with wild brown hair that never quite stays in a ponytail. Usually in a T-shirt with some kind of animal on it, mismatched socks, and slightly grass-stained shorts.  
- **Usual Expression**: Serious, thoughtful, brows slightly furrowed when she’s thinking about snacks or “missions.”

**Background & Family**  
- Lives in a small house with a sloping backyard and one big oak tree.  
- Mother is Cate, who works at a laptop in the kitchen and makes “the good sandwiches.”  
- Madison treats the backyard as a whole world of quests, shortcuts, and secret rules.

**Internal Characteristics**  
- **Core Traits**: Imaginative, earnest, stubborn, easily absorbed in her own internal rules.  
- **Strengths**:  
  - Turns boring errands into adventures.  
  - Notices small details adults miss (like which step on the deck creaks).  
  - Very clear about what she wants, especially when hungry.  
- **Flaws**:  
  - Overdramatic about basic needs (thinks she is “starving” after an hour).  
  - Can be bossy with adults when she’s on a “mission.”  
  - Mildly afraid of the dark under the deck but won’t admit it.

**External Characteristics**  
- **Speech Pattern**:  
  - Simple, direct kid logic: “I’m going to die of hungry, you know.”  
  - Makes rules on the fly: “If I step only on the rocks, the monsters can’t get me.”  
- **Typical Expressions**:  
  - “I have a plan.”  
  - “I’m so, so, so hungry.”  
  - “Wait, I need to think.”  
- **Mannerisms**:  
  - Hugs her stomach when it growls.  
  - Squints up the hill like it’s a mountain.  
  - Narrates her own actions under her breath when she’s nervous.

**Narrative Function**  
- **Goal**: Get a sandwich (ideally exactly the kind she’s imagining) from Cate.  
- **Motivation**: Immediate physical hunger + desire to prove she can handle the “big hill” all by herself.  
- **Arc (in this tiny story)**: From dramatic helplessness (“I’ll starve!”) to small triumph (she makes it up the hill, asks clearly, and comes back with sandwich treasure).

**Writing Notes**  
- Keep her voice grounded in real six-year-old logic, but let the narration amplify her imaginative sense of danger and adventure.  
- Let her take the sandwich quest very seriously, even when the adult reader knows it’s just the backyard.
