#### The Backyard Hill

**Basic Information**  
- **Type**: Residential backyard  
- **Physical Description**: A gently sloping patch of grass leading up from the back fence to the house. One large oak tree leans slightly over the yard. A wooden deck with stairs overlooks the grass.  

**Atmosphere (Child’s POV)**  
- To Madison, the slope is a “huge hill” that must be climbed very carefully.  
- The shadows under the deck are “cave monsters” if she steps too close.  
- The big oak tree doubles as a watchtower and a place where “scouts” (squirrels) report on who’s coming.

**Sensory Details**  
- Grass thick enough to brush her ankles, damp if it’s late in the day.  
- Faint smell of earth, cut grass, and whatever is cooking in the kitchen above.  
- Distant hum of neighborhood sounds: a dog barking, a lawnmower, a car door closing.

**Narrative Function**  
- Serves as the main “map” for Madison’s quest: fence (starting point), hill (journey), deck stairs (final climb), sliding glass door (gateway to Cate and the sandwich).  
- Makes an ordinary backyard feel big and slightly perilous through kid logic.

**Writing Notes**  
- When describing from Madison’s POV, exaggerate distance and steepness.  
- From Cate’s POV, it’s just “the yard” outside the kitchen window.
