#### Thread: The Sandwich Quest

**Summary**  
The recurring pattern where Madison’s hunger becomes a full “quest” up the hill to the house to negotiate for a sandwich from Cate.

**Current State (early chapter)**  
- Madison is genuinely hungry and has convinced herself she might “starve” if she doesn’t get a sandwich soon.  
- She believes the hill and the yard have rules that must be followed (step on stones, avoid shadows) for her to reach the kitchen safely.  
- Cate is busy but willing to feed her once she actually shows up and asks clearly.

**Future State (later, not yet revealed)**  
- Madison will learn that she can ask for food before she is in full meltdown.  
- The hill will feel a little less like a mountain as she grows braver, but she will still frame errands as “missions.”

**Continuity Notes**  
- Madison must not already have eaten a big snack in this chapter when she claims to be “starving.”  
- Cate should not act surprised that Madison comes up the hill; this has happened before.
