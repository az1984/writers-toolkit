# Madison and the Sandwich Quest

High-level premise:  
Madison, a six-year-old with a big imagination and a bigger appetite, treats the short walk up her backyard hill as an epic quest to get a sandwich from her mom, Cate.

---

## Act 1 — The Hill Is Huge

### Chapter 1 — The Hill and the Hunger

- Establish Madison’s world: small house, sloping backyard, big oak tree, wooden deck, kitchen above.
- Madison’s stomach growls; she is convinced she is “so, so, so hungry” and might “starve” if she doesn’t get a sandwich soon.
- The backyard hill becomes an exaggerated landscape in her mind:  
  - Shadows under the deck = “cave monsters.”  
  - Oak tree = watchtower.  
  - Stones in the grass = safe stepping stones.
- Cate is inside, working at the kitchen table, distracted but kind.

**Key beats for Chapter 1:**

1. Madison recognizes the hunger as a “quest alarm” and names the mission: The Sandwich Quest.
2. She studies the hill from the fence and invents rules: only step on stones, avoid the dark under the deck, reach the stairs before “the monsters” notice.
3. Along the way up, she dramatizes normal things (a squirrel, a breeze, a creaky step) into challenges.
4. Madison reaches the deck and the sliding door, negotiates with Cate for a sandwich.
5. Cate listens, amused but respectful, and agrees: sandwich time.
6. Madison returns down the hill with sandwich “treasure,” feeling triumphant and slightly less afraid of the hill.

**Thematic notes:**

- Ordinary life framed through kid epic scale.
- Small, safe independence: Madison solves her own problem by acting instead of just complaining.
- Cate supports the imagination without feeding the panic.
