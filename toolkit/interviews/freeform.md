# Freeform Creative Interview

## Purpose
Unstructured brainstorming for ideas that don't fit other categories

## Special Commands
- `breakpoint`: Pauses session to adjust direction
- `bundle`: Saves transcript to versioned file
- `develop`: Expands on selected idea
- `record`: Saves to appropriate project file
- `tag`: Marks ideas for follow-up

## Workflow
1. **Ideation**:
   - Free-flowing idea exchange
   - No fixed questions or structure

2. **Development**:
   - Select promising ideas to expand
   - Connect to existing story elements

3. **Organization**:
   - Tag ideas by type (character/plot/world)
   - Save to relevant locations:
     - `Ideas/[type]/[timestamp].md`
     - Cross-linked in project files

## Example Flow
```
User: What if dragons could smell lies?
AI: Interesting! That would affect:
- Legal systems
- Social interactions
- Spy networks
User: develop legal systems
AI: Dragon-judged courts where:
- Truth-sensing replaces evidence
- Perjury is impossible
- But dragons have their own biases
User: record
AI: Saved to Ideas/worldbuilding/dragon_courts.md
```

## Output Options
1. Raw ideas: `Ideas/raw/[timestamp].md`
2. Developed concepts: `Ideas/developed/[topic].md`
3. Integrated elements: Added to relevant project files
